# Carpül
An application to help people carpool.

## Usage
In order to run our application you can visit the link at https://seng513carpul.herokuapp.com/ 
This is the easiest way to use the application. However sometimes Heroku is slow to use especially when first starting, so if you want to run it locally there are a few more steps that need to be followed. 

Step 1: Clone the repository from the GitHub link: https://github.com/s-seguin/Carpul. Or use the .zip file handed in to unpack the project.

Step 2: Make sure Node.js is installed on your system

Step 3: Run “npm install” from the Carpul folder in order to make sure you have all dependencies

Step 4: Start the server with the node.js command “node ./bin/www” 

Step 5: Navigate to localhost:3000 on a browser

Step 6: You should now be able to interact with our app as you see fit.
